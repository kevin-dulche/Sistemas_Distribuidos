This program performs red-black successive over-relaxation
on a grid.  The only printed output is the execution time.  By default
10 iterations are performed on a grid of 1000 by 1000 single-precision
floating-point numbers.

Examples:

1.  The following command performs 100 iterations on the default grid
size by the first 4 machines in your $(HOME)/.Tmkrc file.

	sor.udp -i100 -- -n4

2.  The following command performs the default number of iterations
on a grid of size 2048 by 1024 using all of the machines in your
$(HOME)/.Tmkrc file.

	sor.udp -m2048 -n512

The width of the grid is set by the argument "-n".  The actual width
is twice the value provided with "-n".
