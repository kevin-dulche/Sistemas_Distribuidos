The default input is the 18 city problem.

Examples:

1. The following command solves the 18 city problem on the first 8 nodes
in your $(HOME)/.Tmkrc file.

	tsp.udp -f18 -- -n8

The correct answer for the minimum tour length is 106.

2. The following command solves the 19 city problem on the machines
named alpha and beta.

	tsp.udp -f19b -- -h alpha -h beta

The correct answer for the minimum tour length is 149.

The 19 city problem takes almost ten times longer to run
than the 18 city problem.
