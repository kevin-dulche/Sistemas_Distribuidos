This directory contains source files and scripts that are 
not actually part of TreadMarks(TM), but that are needed
to run it under Linux.

getopt.c  is the Berkeley BSD4.4 version.  The GNU getopt.c
	distributed with Linux is feature-full, but incompatible
	with other systems.  

f77     is a shell script that drives the f2c translator and gcc.
	This version differs from the one distributed as part
	of Slakware in three ways: It looks for f2c in /usr/local/bin.
	It has a -U to handle case-sensitive codes.  It has a fix
	for a bug in the distributed version that kept it from working
	with bash on our Linux systems.  You (or your syatem administrator)
	should copy it to an appropriate place in your PATH.
