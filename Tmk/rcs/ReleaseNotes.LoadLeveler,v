@Release Notes for the TreadMarks(tm) extension to support LoadLeveler. 

This distribution includes two versions of the TreadMarks library.
They are both in ./lib.rs6k:

libTmk_udp.a	is the standard TreadMarks library.  This version runs
		on SP2 nodes that allow interactive logins.  This is
		useful for development and debugging.

libTmk_udp_ll.a is the extended version of TreadMarks library that
		runs in EITHER interactive mode like the standard
		TreadMarks library OR in batch mode under LoadLeveler.
		Furthermore, it is capable of autosensing whether it
		was started by LoadLeveler or by an interactive shell. 

		Under LoadLever, the interactive debugging and display
		options are disabled.  Since LoadLeveler determines
		which hosts are used, the .Tmkrc file and the "-h"
		command line directive are ignored.

		This version of TreadMarks still uses the UDP/IP
		protocol through sockets.  The LoadLeveler command
		file determines whether TreadMarks uses Ethernet or
		the high-speed switch.  (Please see the sample command
		file below.)  We are testing a version of TreadMarks
		that uses the PE/MPL user-space CSS directly.  This
		will be released in the near future. 

To make the LoadLeveler version of a sample application, run "make"
in the application directory, "./apps/?/bin.rs6k".

What follows is a LoadLeveler command file that will run the barrier
test program (./apps/test/bin.rs6k/barrier.udp_ll) on 4 processors
using the high speed switch at the Cornell Theory Center.  Command
files for other applications and/or installations will be similar.
Please refer to your site's configuration documents for details such
as the available job classes. 

#!/bin/ksh
#@@ job_name = barrier
#@@ class = small_short
#@@ requirements = (Adapter == "hps_ip")
#@@ data_limit = 50mb
#@@ initialdir = .
#@@ environment = COPY_ALL
#@@ output = Log.$(cluster).$(process).out
#@@ error = Log.$(cluster).$(process).err
#@@ job_type = parallel
#@@ min_processors = 4
#@@ max_processors = 4
#@@ queue
barrier.udp_ll

Note that there are two versions of the TreadMarks Library 
in lib.rs6k:

libTmk_udp.a    is the standard TreadMarks.  This version can
  be run on SP2 nodes that allow interactive logins.  This is
  useful for development and debugging, but performance can suffer
  because interactive nodes are usually shared with other users.

libTmk_udp_ll.a  is a version of TreadMarks that can run in batch mode
  under LoadLeveler.  

  In batch mode debugging and display options are inappropriate, so
  they are disabled.

  This version is still using the UDP/IP communication protocol.
  If the LoadLeveler command file requests it, this version will
  use the IP over the high performance switch of the SP2.  We are
  testing a version that uses the PE/MPL user-space CSS directly.
  This will be released in the near future.

  This version expects LoadLeveler to provide the set of hosts
  on which to run.  Any use of a .Tmkrc file or -hhostname on 
  the command line are ignored.

  The maximum number of nodes in this demo version is 8.

To
make the LoadLeveler versions run "make ll" in the directories
"Tmkll.demo/apps/*/bin.rs6k".

In the directory Tmkll.demo/apps/test/bin.rs6k/LoadL.commands, there
are LoadLeveler command files that were used to run the test programs
at the Cornell Theory Center.  You can use them as examples for
creating your own.

This is a demo copy of TreadMarks-0.9.3 with pre-release extensions
to run under LoadLeveler on IBM SP2s.  It has been used internally
by the TreadMarks group as well as by employees of IBM and APR.

  There is one  small extension beyond the standard version 0.9.3 
  described elsewhere --    
  The standard version must be started on the first host mentioned.
  This version can generally be started from any of the hosts specified, 
  either on the command line or in a .Tmkrc file.
